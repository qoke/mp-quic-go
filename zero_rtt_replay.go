//
// Every session ticket issued by the server contains a random ID and the time it was issued.
// When a client uses a session ticket for 0-RTT, UseTicket is called before 0-RTT is accepted.

// share the session ticket keys of the tls.Config. Deployments with several servers should therefore use a cache
// shared by these servers.
